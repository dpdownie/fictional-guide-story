Many, many years ago, in a forest far away, there lived a fox named Ubuntu.
Ubuntu was a clever fox, and could not be tricked by any of the forest dwellers.
He never had to hunt, for his silver tongue allowed him to persuade his neighbors
to share their food without fail. Conceited and carefree, Ubuntu had the entire
forest at his beck and call--or so he thought.

Ubuntu was about halfway through his life when crisis hit: his midlife crisis. 
Being such a foxy forest phenomenom isn't easy to keep up, and even the moss
on the underside of the lazy willow trees could see the obvious: Ubuntu was slipping.
That's not a metaphor or a euphemism. Ubuntu's balance had started to deteriorate. 
Once a feared hunter, Ubuntu's existential dread combined with his age-related joint
pain manifested in rather poor balance. He feared that phyiscal therapy would be in
the near future, and he knew good and well that physical therapy is no place for a fox.
