Many, many years ago, in a forest far away, there lived a fox named Ubuntu.
Ubuntu was a clever fox, and could not be tricked by any of the forest dwellers.
He never had to hunt, for his silver tongue allowed him to persuade his neighbors
to share their food without fail. Conceited and carefree, Ubuntu had the entire
forest at his beck and call--or so he thought.
